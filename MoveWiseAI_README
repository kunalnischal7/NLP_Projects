# ðŸ§  NLP-Driven Logistics Tracking System

This project integrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with **SQL** to create a seamless logistics tracking system. Users can ask **natural language queries** (e.g., *"How long did Article 1 stay at Sydney?"*), and the system **automatically converts** them into **SQL queries** to fetch results.

- âœ… **Timestamp-Based Tracking** â€“ `Start_Timestamp`, `End_Timestamp`
- âœ… **Dwell & Transit Time Calculation** â€“ Accurate shipment analytics
- âœ… **SQLite Integration** â€“ Fast, in-memory database for real-time queries
